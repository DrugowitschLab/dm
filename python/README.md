Usage
-----

The Python module can be built by calling

```Shell
python setup.py build
```

and installed by

```Shell
python setup.py install
```

at the command line. The Python module should be compatible with both Python 2 and 3. See the header comment in [ddmmodule.c](ddmmodule.c) for how to call the different functions provided by the module.
